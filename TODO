TODO

- maybe add a prefix for private methods (that are not exposed in the header files)

- documentation of listSpanningTrees!


- buffered canonicalString method that uses a preallocated array of ShallowGraph* for the qsort step
- speedup of labeledSubtreeIsomorphism by merging bipartite matching inside the subtree iso


THEORY
- is it useful to choose particular roots for subgraph iso checks, e.g. canonical roots?
