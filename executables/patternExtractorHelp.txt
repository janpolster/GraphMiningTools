This program returns some extracted features for each graph in a db.

Usage: ./gpe [OPTIONS] [FILE]

If no FILE argument is given or FILE is - the program reads from stdin.
It always prints to stdout.


Options:

-m METHOD: Specify the features this method should output
    triangles (default):   Compute a set of fingerprints that is based on the
	                       triangles in a graph that contain at least two edges
	                       that are present. For sparse graphs, this is much
	                       faster than brute force enumeration of all induced
	                       subgraphs of size 3.
    triples:               Compute a set of fingerprints based on the set of all
                           induced subgraphs of size 3.
