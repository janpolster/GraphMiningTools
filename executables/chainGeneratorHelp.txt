This program generates a database of random graphs that are chains of 
cycles, each connected to the next on a single articulation vertex.

Usage: cgen [ARGS] 
or cgen [ARGS] FILE

the first reads from stdin.

Parameters:
  -N int:    specify number of generated graphs (default 100)
  -a int:    lower bound on number of cycles in each graph (default 1)
  -b int:    upper bound on number of cycles in each graph (default 50)
  -c int:    number of different vertex labels. If this value is smaller
             than 1, label each vertex by its number. (default -1)
  -d int:    number of different edge labels (default 1)
  -m int:    number of vertices in each cycle
  -s int:    random seed (default 100)
