A small program to compute canonical strings for trees.
Implemented 2015 by Pascal Welke.

Input is a database in the usual format, output is one line per graph, which
is either a canonical string of the graph if the graph is a tree, or 'No Tree'
if the graph is not a tree.

Usage: cstring [options] [FILE]

By default, or if FILE is '-', gf reads from stdin. It always outputs to
stdout.

Options:
    -h Print this help and exit

    -l Use Molecular label representation instead of integer label representation

    -u Unsafe: Skip the test whether a graph is a tree. Probably results in secfault
       or other nasty stuff, if the database contains non-tree graphs.
