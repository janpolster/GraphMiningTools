TODO

- subtree iso for labelled trees
- maybe add a prefix for private methods (that are not exposed in the header files)

- documentation of listSpanningTrees!
- how to go on?

- how does the canonical string stuff work, again?
- save patterns / "model" to disk and load it, again...

THEORY
- is it useful to choose particular roots for subgraph iso checks, e.g. canonical roots?
