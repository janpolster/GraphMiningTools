TODO

- move isLeaf() from subtreeIsomorphism to graph
- subtree iso for labelled trees
- maybe add a prefix for private methods (that are not exposed in the header files)

- documentation of listSpanningTrees!
- declutter graph.c
- how to go on?

- how does the canonical string stuff work, again?
- save patterns / "model" to disk and load it, again...
- subtree isomorphism...
