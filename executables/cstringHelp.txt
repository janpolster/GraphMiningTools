A small program to compute canonical strings for trees.
Implemented 2015,2018 by Pascal Welke.

Usage: cstring [options] [FILE]

By default, or if FILE is '-', cstring reads from stdin. It always outputs to
stdout.


Default case (without switches):

Input is a database in the usual format, output is one line per graph, which
is either a canonical string of the graph if the graph is a tree, or 'No 
Tree' if the graph is not a tree.

The canonical string output has the same format as the pattern output of lwg. That is:

%i\t%i\t%s

where the first integer is a count (here, always 1), the second integer is the id
of the graph (as in the input database) and the string is the cstring or 'no tree',
as mentioned above.


Options:
    -h Print this help and exit

    -u Unsafe:  Skip the test whether a graph is a tree. Probably results in 
                secfaults or other nasty stuff, if the database contains 
                non-tree graphs.
               
    -i Inverse: Convert from a canonical string database to a graph database.
