TODO

- levelwise: pruning and embedding should be separated.
- buffered canonicalString method that uses a preallocated array of ShallowGraph* for the qsort step
- speedup of labeledSubtreeIsomorphism by merging bipartite matching inside the subtree iso
- separate sampling methods from treeSamplingMain.c into a lib file


THEORY

- is it useful to choose particular roots for subgraph iso checks, e.g. canonical roots?


DONE 

- documentation of listSpanningTrees!
- check if isMaximalOuterplanar checks MAXIMAL outerplanar or just outerplanar: checks outerplanar
- maybe add a prefix for private methods (that are not exposed in the header files)
