This is a frequent rooted subtree mining tool.
Implemented by Pascal Welke starting in 2018.

This program computes and outputs frequent *rooted* subtrees and feature
representations of the mined graphs. The database is expected to contain
tree transactions that are interpreted as being rooted at the first
vertex.

usage: ./lwg [options] [FILE]

If no FILE argument is given or FILE is - the program reads from stdin.
It always prints to stdout (unless specified by parameters) and 
stderr (statistics).


Options:
-h:           print this possibly helpful information.

-t THRESHOLD: Minimum absolute support threshold in the graph database

-p SIZE:      Maximum size (number of vertices) of patterns returned

-o FILE:      output the frequent subtrees in this file

-f FILE:      output the feature information in this file

-i VALUE:     Some embedding operators require a parameter that might be
              a float between 0.0 and 1.0 or an integer >=1, depending 
              on the operator.
              
-r VALUE:     Initialize the random number generator with seed VALUE. If
              not specified, random generator is seeded according to 
              current time.


-m METHOD:    Choose mining method among
              
              bfs: (default) mine in a levelwise fashion (like apriori). 
                 This results in better pruning behavior, but large memory 
                 footprint
      

-e OPERATOR:  Select the algorithm to decide whether a tree pattern 
              matches a transaction graph.
              Choose embedding operator among the following:

         == EXACT TREE EMBEDDING OPERATORS ==
           These operators result in the full set of frequent 
           rooted subtrees being output by this mining algorithm.
         
           rootedTrees: (default) classical subtree isomorphism algorithm.
             A pattern matches a graph, if it is rooted subgraph isomorphic 
             to it. That is, the transactions are interpreted as being rooted
             at their first vertex (in the graph database file format) and the 
             image of the root of the pattern must be the vertex in the image of 
             the pattern with the smallest distance to the root of the transaction.
              Works only for forest transaction databases.

             
         == STRANGE EMBEDDING OPERATORS ==
           These operators do various stuff. The first two are 
           stronger than subgraph isomorphism, requiring possibly
           more than one embedding into a transaction graph to
           match the graph. The third just enumerates all trees
           up to isomorphism that can be created from the vertex 
           and edge labels in the database.
                          
           rootedTreeEnumeration: Enumerate all trees up to isomorphism which 
             can be generated from frequent vertices and edges in the
             input databases.
