This program generates a database of random graphs according to the 
Erdos-Renyi model.

Usage: ggen [ARGS] 
or ggen [ARGS] FILE

the first reads from stdin.

Parameters:
  -N int:    specify number of generated graphs (default 100)
  -a int:    lower bound on number of vertices in each graph (default 1)
  -b int:    upper bound on number of vertices in each graph (default 50)
  -c int:    number of different vertex labels (default 5)
  -d int:    number of different edge labels (default 1)
  -p double: edge probability (default 0.5)
  -m double: (expected) edge multiplicity. If set, p will be computed for 
             each graph, such that the expected number of edges is m*n, 
             where n is the number of vertices, randomly chosen between 
             a and b. (default: do not use this)
  -s int:    random seed (default current system time)
  -x METHOD:
         erdosrenyi: ER Model graphs
         
         overlap: generate n random 2-dim points in the unit cube.
            There exists an edge between v and w iff the euclidean distance
            is smaller than p. (I.p., if p >= sqrt(2), then g is connected.)
