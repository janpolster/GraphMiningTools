TODO

- [ ]  buffered canonicalString method that uses a preallocated array of ShallowGraph* for the qsort step
- [X]  speedup of labeledSubtreeIsomorphism by merging bipartite matching inside the subtree iso
- [ ]  separate sampling methods from treeSamplingMain.c into a lib file
- [ ]  remove countCycleDegree.c and store the only important functionality somewhere (i.e. cycle degrees of all vertices)
- [ ]  treeEnumeration might be too slow, as we do not enumerate perfectly
- [ ]  extract weisfeiler lehman from treesampling into new executable
- [ ]  make optimized vertex and edge counting methods work with importance embedding operator

- a unified levelwise mining executable that does 
	- tree -> tree
	- tree -> forest
	- tree -> cactus (with bounded cycle degree)
	- tree -> k-easy block graph (with bounded cycle degree)
	(also only for paths)

THEORY

- is it useful to choose particular roots for subgraph iso checks, e.g. canonical roots?


DONE 

- levelwise: pruning and embedding should be separated.
- documentation of listSpanningTrees!
- check if isMaximalOuterplanar checks MAXIMAL outerplanar or just outerplanar: checks outerplanar
- maybe add a prefix for private methods (that are not exposed in the header files)
